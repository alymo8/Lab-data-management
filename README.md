# Lab-data-management
A shell script that works on the data output coming from lab results

This shell scripts takes as input a directory, and reads all the .log files in it recursively using the find command. Then reads the wanted fields, and if the sensor output was error, it replaces that with the temperature measured in the previous hour using grep, sed and awk. It also measures the maximum and minimum temperatures measured by the sensors in every hour, and finds which sensor has the highest temperature and which has the lowest. And at the end, we get a brief of the errors made by each sensor and the number of errors reported during each day using awk and sort. The results are shown below and in the file formattedstats.txt attached

Here is the content of the directory we are reading from:

An example of the files we read from is the following (logs from Feb 1)

We only take the date, the hour, and the measurement of every sensor, and format it as a csv file. If a sensor got an error, the measurement is replaced with the one from the previous error. Here is an example of the output:

We also get another part that has the maximum/minimum temperature measured and the corresponding sensor to that temperature printed

And finally, we also get a report of the errors generated by every sensor and the total number of errors reported in each day
